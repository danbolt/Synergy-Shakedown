## About
This is Daniel's repository for Ludum Dare #34, a game jam.

Daniel will be doing the compo, the 48-hour variant.

More information on Ludum Dare can be found [here](http://ludumdare.com/).

## Running

This game is written in HTML5/JavaScript with the Phaser 2 library. To run it locally, you'll need to point a web server at this game's root folder. I'm particularily fond of the `http-server` package [found on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
